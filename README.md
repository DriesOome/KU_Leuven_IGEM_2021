# IPDE Sim 
## By KU_Leuven Igem 2021
#### The program
This program is a CLI interface which allows the user to change parameters of the IPDE model we created. Further details about the model can be found on https://2021.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/Model
For your convenience, the .exe file has already been compiled and residues in the "Compiled program" folder. 
#### Compiling the .exe file using visual studio community edition
1) Open visual studio community edition
2) Press option "open a project or solution"

4) In the top left, change the "Debug" setting to "Release" (enables compiler optimization, code runs faster)
5) In the top navigation bar, go to build -> build solution 
6) The .exe file should appear in the same directory as the git repo, inside the folder "Compiled program".
